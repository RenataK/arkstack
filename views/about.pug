          //- Pitch for potential employees
          p Building user friendly, easy to use applications is a true passion of mine. I aspire to one day work on something millions of people could use. I am detail oreinted, organized and easy to work with. I love all things front-end but learning back-end has become more intriguing and I hope to gain a better understanding of it soon. I love a challenge and hope my work can aspire those around me. 
          p Since as long as I can remember I’ve loved puzzles, anything that challenges my brain to solve, that feeling of finally completing a challenge successfully has always been something I crave. This has brought me to discover coding, it’s not something I ever presumed I’d do, but after a short and simple HTML & CSS course, I was fascinated. The more I began to learn the more I realized how intricate the development world is. And here we are. I am excited to dive into the tech field and discover all that it has to offer, I want to become a vital part of a company, connect with brilliant minds and most importantly inspire others.
